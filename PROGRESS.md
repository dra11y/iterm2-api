## Current Focus
**Phase 1.1**: API Clarity Refactor - This is the highest priority as it fixes a confusing API design that affects all other development.

## Next Steps
1. Complete API clarity refactor (separate create_window from create_tab)
2. Add comprehensive documentation for existing methods
3. Improve existing examples with better error handling
4. Begin Phase 2 implementation (split panes, profile management)
