- **Test Coverage**: 0% (0 automated tests)
- **Python API Alignment**: 5% (basic connection + object design complete)
- **Protobuf Integration**: 80% (identified reusable objects, designed conversion strategy)

## Current Focus
**Phase 1.1**: Architecture Redesign - Currently implementing object-oriented architecture with Window, Tab, Session structs based on protobuf foundations.

## Next Steps
1. Complete Window, Tab, Session struct designs with proper relationships
2. Implement conversion traits from protobuf to Rust structs
3. Add thread-safe connection sharing with Arc<Mutex<>>
4. Implement proper object relationships with weak references to prevent cycles
5. Begin core object implementation starting with Window struct

## Blockers
- **Architecture Decision**: Need to finalize object relationship design (weak references vs other patterns)
- **Safety Considerations**: Must ensure thread safety and prevent memory leaks with circular references
- **API Compatibility**: Breaking changes required - need to plan migration strategy for existing users
