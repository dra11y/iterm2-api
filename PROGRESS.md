### Python API Analysis Results (Updated 2025-09-27)

**API Coverage**: 45 files analyzed, 35 classes, 149 functions, 146 total methods

**Key Parameter Patterns**:
- `connection`: 59 occurrences (most common parameter)
- `name`: 17 occurrences
- `callback`: 15 occurrences  
- `session_id`: 13 occurrences
- `key`: 11 occurrences

**Type Hint Analysis**:
- `Any`: 230 occurrences (most common type)
- `str`: 54 occurrences
- `iterm2.connection.Connection`: 26 occurrences
- `Optional[str]`: 6 occurrences
- `bool`: 5 occurrences

**Critical Insight**: The `connection` parameter appears 59 times, confirming that connection management is central to the API design. This validates our approach of using `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` for thread-safe connection sharing.

## Current Focus
**Phase 1.1**: Architecture Redesign - Core class analysis complete. Analyzed Window, Tab, and Session Python source files to extract design patterns, method signatures, and object relationships. Ready to begin Rust implementation.

## Key Analysis Findings (Updated 2025-09-27)

### Design Patterns Identified
- **Delegate Pattern**: All classes use delegates for object relationships to prevent cycles
- **Connection Management**: Each object holds connection reference, all async operations use `self.connection`
- **Factory Pattern**: Static methods (`async_create()`, `create_from_proto()`) for object creation
- **Object Hierarchy**: Window → Tab → Session tree structure with bidirectional relationships

### Core Method Inventory
- **Window**: 15+ methods including `async_create_tab()`, `async_activate()`, `async_close()`, variable management
- **Tab**: 10+ methods including `async_activate()`, `async_split_pane()`, layout management, navigation
- **Session**: 25+ methods including `async_send_text()`, `async_split_pane()`, profile management, buffer access

### Critical Implementation Requirements
- **Thread Safety**: Use `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` for connection sharing
- **Memory Safety**: Use `Weak<RefCell<T>>` for object relationships to prevent cycles
- **Error Handling**: Specific error types for each class (CreateTabException, SetPropertyException, etc.)
- **Async Patterns**: All operations async, follow naming convention `async_operation_name()`

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Core Object Structure**: Define Window, Tab, Session structs with basic properties and delegate system
2. **Connection Sharing**: Implement `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` pattern for thread-safe connection access
3. **Factory Methods**: Create object creation methods with protobuf conversion
4. **Basic Operations**: Implement essential methods (create, activate, close) for each class
5. **Error Types**: Define specific error types matching Python exception hierarchy
6. **Update Examples**: Migrate existing examples to use new object-oriented API

## Blockers
- **Delegate Implementation**: Need to design Rust equivalent of Python delegate pattern with Weak references
- **Protobuf Integration**: Must design seamless conversion between protobuf and Rust structs
- **Memory Management**: Complex object relationships require careful ownership design
- **API Migration**: Breaking changes needed - plan migration strategy for existing flat API users
